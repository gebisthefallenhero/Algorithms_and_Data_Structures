# Algorithms_and_Data_Structures
Some projects from my CS3 Algorithms and DataStructures Class. Each project I was given some starter code, but most of the code is my own.

* [Project Groups](./ProdjectGroups/src) An implementation of the Belman Ford Algorithm
* [Union Find](./UnionFind/src) An implementation of the union find algorithm.
* [Dynamic Median](./Dynamic_Median/src) An implementation of leftist heaps and skew heaps
* [AVL](./AVL/src) An implementation of AVL trees.
